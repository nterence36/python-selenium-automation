     <h2>Instructions:</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Cold rice or day old rice is best. This helps to prevent and keep the rice from sticking together and getting mushy.
             It does not have to be cold, but it is best to have day old rice instead of fresh rice.</li>
        <li>Scramble the egg in the same pan. To save on dishes you can just slide the veggies to one side and pour the egg in the other side.
             Scramble the egg with a spatula and then combine with the vegetables.</li>
        <li>Use Jasmine or long grain rice. Using a long grain rice will produce the best results and is most commonly used.</li>
        <li>Use Sesame oil. For the authentic flavor this is a MUST! Sesame oil has distinctive nutty aroma that brings the flavors together in this dish.</li>
        <li>Soy sauce is your best friend. Little to a lot is all up to you. Donâ€™t be afraid to go wild or stay true to the recipe.
            You will enjoy the extra flavoring soy sauce has to offer mixed with veggies and rice.</li>
        <li>Cook the veggies and egg in the same pan. This is my favorite trick to making this recipe all in one pan.
            As soon as the veggies are tender just slide them over to the side, pour the eggs onto the other side and scramble. It is as easy as that!</li>
